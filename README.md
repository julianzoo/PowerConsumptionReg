# PowerConsumptionReg
Project in the context of the PS Machine Learning SS24.
We are given a dataset with various features and a value for power consumption. 
Goal of this Project is to develop two regression methods to build a model which predicts the power consumption for some unseen feature-arguments best.

The progress and detailed evaluation of these two regression models are recorded in a Report (pdf).
